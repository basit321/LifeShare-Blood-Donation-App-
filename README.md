# LifeShare-Blood-Donation-App-

LIFESHARE is more efficient, reliable and accessible than the existing system, and will greatly improve the chances of finding the right blood type and location in emergency situations. Finding blood donors in an emergency can be overwhelming for patients and their families. The current system in place mainly relies on word-of-mouth on contacting local hospitals, clinics and blood banks, which can be time-consuming and may not always yield the desired results, especially in remote areas or during shortages. This can leave patients struggling to find the necessary blood type and location, leading to a lot of information gap among patients, donors, and medical facilities. With limited resources, it becomes even harder for hospitals to reach a large number of donors in short time, especially in case of rare blood type or shortage of blood. The Blood Donor Finder app aims to bridge this gap by connecting patients in need with verified blood donors and blood banks in real-time, providing a more efficient, reliable and accessible solution in emergency situations.
